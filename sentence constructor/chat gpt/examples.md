Clues and Considerations
For the first sentence:

You need to use the past form of "to see."
"This morning" should go at the beginning.
The subject is implied in casual speech but is typically "you."
"The raven" is the object.
End the sentence with a question marker.
For the second sentence:

"They" refers to the raven, so use the correct pronoun or omit it if unnecessary.
The verb "to look" needs to be in the progressive form (i.e., "was looking").
"Our garden" should include the correct possessive form.
The sentence should end in the correct tense.
