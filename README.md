### Japanese Sentence Constructor

## Description

The Japanese Sentence Constructor project is a learning application that helps users translate sentences from English to Japanese by providing interactive assistance, without giving them the direct answer.

## Features

Allows users to input an English sentence and receive guidance in constructing it in Japanese. Integrates an AI assistant capable of providing contextual and grammatical suggestions, completing the work of a teacher. Maintains a conversation history to support progressive learning.

LLM 7B for text comprehension and generation. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to improve the relevance of responses. Vector Database to efficiently store and retrieve linguistic data. Prompt Cache to optimize speed and reduce inference costs. Guardrails to secure the AI's inputs and outputs. Architecture

The architecture relies on an AI assistant in addition to a human teacher. The assistant maintains a history of interactions and tailors suggestions based on the user's learning level.

## Objectives

Provide a smooth and progressive learning experience. Reduce dependency on a human teacher while maintaining an option for those who prefer it. Ensure linguistic immersion with real-time feedback on sentence construction. Note on the Role of the Teacher

The teacher's role can be excluded if the AI assistant is sufficiently comprehensive and performant. However, some students prefer to interact with a human teacher for a more engaging and personalized experience. For these cases, AI characters can be used if desired to simulate a teacher-like role.

## Conclusion

The Japanese Sentence Constructor aims to improve Japanese learning by combining artificial intelligence with traditional teaching methods. It adapts to students' preferences, whether they choose to interact with a human teacher or an AI character similar to a teacher.
